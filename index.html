                        The Battle for Castle Itter was one of the last battles to be fought in the European Theater during World War 2. Fought on May 5th, 1945 in the Austrian North Tyrol Castle Itter.
                        The castle is a small one on the hill just north of the village of Itter in Austria, occupied by the German army during the war. General Oswald Pohl seized the castle from the previous 
                        owner, Franz Grüner on February 7th, 1943. Pohl then transformed the castle into a prison camp, completing its transformation on the 25th of April 1943.
                        The prison was established to contain high-profile French prisoners that were deemed valuable to the <em>Reich</em>. Besides these "VIP Prisoners", the castle held numerous Eastern 
                        European prisoners detached from the Dachau Concentration Camp who were used for maintenance around the castle.

                    <h3>The Battle</h3>
                    <p>A very good synopsis of the battle in the form of a video if you would rather listen instead of read.</p>
                    <video src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0UwLhziocc" width="50%" height="50%" controls> Video Not Supported</video>
                    <p> On May 3rd 1945, the imprisoned Yugoslav communist resistance member Zvonimir Čučković working as a handyman at the prison, 
                        left the castle for preform errands for the prisons commander Sebastian Wimmer
                        Čučković carried a letter written in English, asking for Allied aid to, to give to the first American he found. 
                    </p>
                    <p> Čučković found his way to Innsbruck and reached the advanced party of the 409th Infantry Regiment of the American 103rd Infantry Division and 
                        informed them of the prisoners residing in the castle. They were not permited to mount a rescue mission at the moment, but ensured an 
                        answer from HQ in the morning. At dawn, a heavily armored rescue mission begun but was swiftly stopped by shelling just about half way to Itter.
                    </p>
                    <p> On May 2nd, the prisons commander, Sebastian Wimmer, feared for his life after the former commanders death and Čučković's failure to return.
                        Shortly after the <em>SS-Totenkopfverbände</em> guards followed suite and left the prisoners there who then armed themselves and took over the castle for themselves.
                    </p>
                    <p> The prison leaders, not knowing the results of Čučković's effort, sent Andreas Krobot to the city of Wörgl with a similar note. He then succeeded in contacting 
                        Austrian resistance in that town which had recently been abandoned by <em>Wehrmacht</em> forces but was reoccupied by <em>Waffen-SS</em> troops.
                        Andreas was then taken to Major Josef Gangl, who sought to maintain his presence in town to protect the locals from the SS. Gangl's hopes where for the Americans to 
                        reach the town and surrender to them, but now he must ask for there help.
                    </p>
                    <p> At the same time this was happening, a recon team of four sherman tanks commanded by Captain Lee was asked to provide relief by Gangl, without hesitation, Lee volunteered 
                        to lead a rescue mission.
                    </p>
                    <p> After personal reconnaissance of the castle with Gangl himself, Lee began his assault on the castle. Leaving one of his tanks at the bridge to guard it, he set off accompanies only by 14
                        American soldiers, Gangl, a driver for Gangl's vehicle, and a truck carrying ten former German artillerymen. 4 miles from the castle, they defeated a party of SS troops that had been attempting
                        to set up a roadblock.
                    </p>
                    <p> Meanwhile, the French Prisoners had requested an SS officer, Kurt- Siegfried Schrader, whom they befriended in Itter, to take charge of their defense. Once Lee arrived at the castle, prisoners
                        welcomed them and warmly greeted them, but were dissapointed in the small size of the rescue force. defying Lee's orders, the French prisoners remained outside and fought alongside the American
                        and <em>Wehrmacht</em> soldiers. On the night of May 4th, the defenders were harassed by reconnaissance forces sent to gauge their strength and weaknesses.
                    </p>
                    <p> On the morning of May 5th, 1945, Only 5 days after Hitlers Suicide, a 150 strong force of <em>Waffen-SS</em> mounted their attack. Before the main assault, Gangl phoned Alois Mayr, the Austrian resistance leade in Wörgl and request
                        reinforcements. Only 2 German soldiers and a teen, Hans Waltl, from the resistance could be spared. The Sherman tank was able to support via machine gun fire, until it was destroyed by German 88 fire.
                        In the meantime, come afternoon, the 142nd Infantry Regiment of the despiration of the defenders, and dispatched a relief force. Aware of his flaw in not giving the 142nd complete information, Lee 
                        accepted tennis star Jean Borotra's offer to vault the castle wall and run the gauntlet of SS ambushes to deliver it. He succeeded, requested a uniform, then joined the reinforcements as they made 
                        their way to the castle with haste before the defenders where no more.
                    </p>
                    <p> The reinforcements arrived around 4 pm, and the SS were swiftly defeated. Among the defending party's dead, Josef Gangl. He died trying to relocate the French
                        Prime Minister where he would not be harmed. Upwards of 100 prisoners were reportedly taken, and the French Prisoners were released and 
                        and made it to Paris by May 10th.
